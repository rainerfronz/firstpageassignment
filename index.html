        <h3 class="text-center">About Rainer</h3>
        <p> After graduating from <a href="www.stolaf.edu">St Olaf College</a> with a BA in Political Science I was
          undecided on my next steps. I began working in the service industry to make ends meet until a career path
          became clear. While home schooling my daughter and working with her on her STEM
          lessons, coding peaked my interest.
          I also run <a href="http://www.learningcurverecords.com">Learning Curve Records</a> a small independent record
          label based out of Minneapolis. With the label I have worked with musicans and businesses around the world
          building and maintaining networks and positive releations.
          Besides keeping busy with Thinkful and my record label, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with
          my daughter. We love to garden and build things together. Cooking global cuisine and creating Home Brew
          Beer are what I try to do when I have some rare free time!</p>
        <p> I am currently a student at Thinkful in the Software Engineering program and I am so excited to be learning
          and creating in the program. </p>
        <p>If you are looking to hire a new Web Developer / Software Engineer, get in touch! I am looking to continue
          learning and colaborate on web projects big and small.
