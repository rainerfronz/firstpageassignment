        <h3 class="text-center">About Rainer</h3>
        <p> After graduating from <a href="www.stolaf.edu">St Olaf College</a> with a BA in Political Science I was
          undecided on my next steps. I began working in the service industry to make ends meet until a career path
          became clear. After 20+ years managing and bar tending in various local institutions around Minneapolis and St
          Paul, I have finally landed on a passion. While home schooling my daughter working with her on her STEM
          lessons peaked my interest in coding.THerefor Web development and Software Engineering became an obsession. I
          also run <a href="http://www.learningcurverecords.com">Learning Curve Records</a> a small independent record
          label. Besides keeping busy with Thinkful and my record label, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with
          my Daughter Iris. We love to garden and build things together. </p>
        <p> I am currently a student at Thinkful in the Software Engineering program and I am so excited to be learning
          and creating in the program. </p>
        <p>If you are looking to hire a new Web Developer / Software Engineer, get in touch! I am looking to continue
          learning and colaborate on web projects big and small.
